# CS2511 Project

Our CS2511 project consisted of:

- Analysing an e-commerce site based on usability/accessibility guidelines, and compiling our report in the form of a webpage that adhered to these same usability guidelines.
- Designing an improved interface as a limited-functionality prototype that makes effective use of the interaction widgets & techniques supported by HTML5 and JQuery
